# Best practices for using pnpm as a package manager

- Use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` for consistent dependencies across environments
- Leverage pnpm's workspace feature for monorepos
- Regularly update dependencies using `pnpm update`
- Use `pnpm dlx` for running one-off scripts without installing globally
- Take advantage of pnpm's faster installation times and smaller disk usage
