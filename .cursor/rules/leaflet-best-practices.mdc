# Best practices for using Leaflet in mapping applications

- Use Leaflet's built-in methods for efficient map interactions
- Implement proper event handling for map clicks and hovers
- Optimize GeoJSON loading by filtering data on the server-side when possible
- Use Leaflet's `onEachFeature` function to bind custom behaviors to map elements
- Consider using Leaflet plugins for advanced functionality like map exporting
